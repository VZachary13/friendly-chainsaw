# SVG Logo-Maker

## Description

I made this project so I could generate a number of logos for personal or professional use. This project solves the issue of branding. instead of going to some third party logo maker's website and paying for a logo i can use this to make my own basic logos. this program could easily scale to be able to create even more varied and unique logos. I learned what an SVG file is and what it takes to make an SVG file. I also learned how to manipulate classes across multiple files and proper testing of material.

## Installation
